 Iceland, the country, is considering legal action against Iceland, the British supermarket chain, over the use of its name, according to U.K. media. The Icelandic foreign ministry said it doesn't want the retailer to give up its brand, but wants to make sure it does not stand in the way of Icelandic firms that want to register the name “Iceland” in the EU, the Independent reports Friday. A spokesman for the foreign ministry said legal action was "being looked into." “We are looking for a 'live and let live' outcome,” said Jon Asbergsson, managing director of Promote Iceland, an agency linked to the Icelandic foreign ministry. Iceland Foods, which has 800 stores across Britain, has been in business since 1970. "We are not aware that our use of the Iceland name has ever caused any confusion with Iceland the country," a spokesperson for the chain said. “We didn't make any objections in the beginning, as we were never going to be running any supermarkets,” Asbergsson said. “But over the course of the years they have been registering the name in several other categories and companies that have Iceland in the name.”
