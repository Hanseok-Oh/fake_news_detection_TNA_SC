 Rodrigo Duterte, the controversial president of the Philippines, used industrial language to describe the European Union on Tuesday after calls for him to halt a wave of killings as part of a war on drugs. Members of the European Parliament last week said they were concerned about the "extraordinarily high numbers killed during police operations in the context of an intensified anti-crime and anti-drug campaign." In a statement, they said: “MEPs urge the Philippines government to put an end to the current wave of extrajudicial executions and killings, launch an immediate investigation into them and adopt specific, comprehensive policies and programs in full compliance with national and international obligations and respect for human rights.” Duterte's response was brief. “I read the condemnation of the EU against me. I will tell them, ‘f--k you.’ You’re doing it in atonement for your sins,” he told local government officials in Davao City, media in the Philippines reported. The president said EU nations were hypocrites for attacking him because of their own bloody histories. "And then EU now has the gall to condemn me. I repeat it, ‘f--k you,’” he said. Duterte earlier this month called Barack Obama a "son of a b--ch" when it was suggested he would face questioning by the U.S. president about the war on drug crime, which has claimed more than 2,400 lives in just over two months.
