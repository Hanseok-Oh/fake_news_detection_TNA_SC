 The anti-Donald Trump movement is on its death bed, the Republican presidential nominee boasted on Wednesday. “You’ll hear about these Never Trumpers, who are dying.

These were Never Trump, Never Trump, Never Trump and now they’re — believe me, they see lower taxes, they see cutting the regulations, they see job creation, which is so important, and it’s really been amazing.” “And one of the things that they see and that you people see,” he told the group of pastors inside a Cleveland church, “is that — and so important — the judges.
