 Donald Trump will not be fazed by the presence of another brash billionaire businessman, Mark Cuban, in the front row of the upcoming debate, the Republican nominee's campaign asserted Friday.

And Mark Cuban, sitting right there in front of him," Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo said during a discussion with national spokeswoman Katrina Pierson.
