"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing ... and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business" — Hillary Clinton. It’s a favorite line of almost all politicians, and Hillary Clinton has used it before. But small businesses are not in fact the job creators. That role belongs to new businesses. One recent study used Census data to look at job creation in 2005. It found that startups created 3.5 million net new jobs—a million more than were created in the entire private sector. In other words, non-startup businesses were responsible that year for a 1 million job decline in employment.
