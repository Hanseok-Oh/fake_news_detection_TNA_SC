Hillary Clinton has been given the "Between Two Ferns" treatment. The Democratic presidential nominee sat down for an interview on the Funny or Die talk show hosted by comedian Zach Galifianakis. During the interview -- posted today, but taped the Friday Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia -- Clinton jokes about Donald Trump, her pantsuits and the "double standard" of being a woman running for office, among other things. Mid-interview she says bluntly: "I really regret doing this."Here's a sampling of some of the best jokes: Clinton: "I assume he'll wear, you know, that red power tie." Galifianakis: "Or maybe like a white power tie...." Clinton: "That's even more appropriate." Galifianakis: "As secretary, how many words per minute could you type? And how does President Obama like his coffee? Like himself ... weak?" Clinton: "You know, Zach those are really out of date questions ... you need to get out more." Galifianakis: "What happens if you become pregnant? Are we going to be stuck with Tim Kaine for nine months? How does this work?" Galifianakis: "Not to take away from the historic significance [of your campaign] ... but for a younger, younger generation, you also become their first white president and that's pretty neat, too." Galifianakis: "When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows and did Michelle Obama write Melania's?" Clinton: "I really couldn't see or hear very well, so I'm not quite sure what his vows were. But I'm sure they were great and huge and wonderful." Galifianakis: "Like his bowels." Clinton: [Rolls eyes, laughs] Galifianakis: "We should stay in touch ... what's the best way to reach you? Email?" Clinton: [Silent.]
