 President Barack Obama joked Thursday that actor Morgan Freeman couldn’t make it to a White House ceremony for National Medals of the Arts and Humanities recipients because he “undoubtedly is off playing a black president again.” “He never lets me have my moment,” the president added once the laughter subsided.

We will all be arrested for this movie,’” the president said in his introductory remarks. “Now to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin and the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him,” Obama continued. “And that I think, is [what] the arts and humanities do: They lift up our identities and make us see ourselves in each other.”
