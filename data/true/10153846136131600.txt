 Rome's new mayor Virginia Raggi on Wednesday pulled the plug on the Italian capital's ambition to become a candidate to host the 2024 Olympics. Raggi, a member of the anti-establishment 5Star Movement and the first female mayor of Rome, argued that hosting the Olympics would leave Rome more indebted than it is now and that the infrastructure built for the Olympics would turn intoÂ "cathedrals in the desert" after the event. "It is irresponsible to approve this candidacy," Raggi told reporters in Rome Wednesday. With Rome out of the contest, three cities, Paris, Los Angeles and Budapest, remain in the race to host the Olympic Games eight years from now. During her election campaign, Raggi had expressed doubts whether Rome, a deeply indebted city which has been struggling with waste management problem for months, should host the sporting event. She had stopped short of saying she would withdraw Rome's candidacy if elected mayor, raising hopes among supporters of the project, including Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, that she could change her mind The International Olympic Committee will choose the city that will host the 2024 Games in a year's time. This article has been updated to confirm the bid's withdrawal.
