 The Senate will vote on Wednesday to override President Barack Obama’s veto of legislation that would allow the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday.

Story Continued Below Congress is expected to easily clinch the two-thirds support needed to override Obama’s veto, which would be the first veto override of his presidency.

They warn that the legislation could open up U.S. officials abroad to retaliation.
