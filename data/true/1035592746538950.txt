Ivanka Trump now has her own Secret Service protection, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. Before now, Trump's adult children only received protection while physically near the candidate. But Ivanka Trump will now receive Secret Service protection assigned to her directly. Earlier this month, Chelsea Clinton received her own Secret Service protection, as well. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump still do not have their own protection, as of the latest information.
