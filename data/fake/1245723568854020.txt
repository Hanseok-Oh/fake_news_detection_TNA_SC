Famed television host and veteran Montel Williams got into it this weekend with Trump-supporting Pastor Mark Burns, who took to Twitter to complain about the mainstream media’s refusal to jump to conclusions and immediately call the weekend’s bombing in New York “terrorism.” Montel, a New Yorker, was not about to let the Trump apologist get away with repeating the same fear-mongering narrative that Trump repeats after every terrorist attack that takes place in the West. Montel called him and Trump out for being a con men, shaming him for being a pastor with the nerve to support a narcissist like Trump. Donald Trump clearly believes that he is a minor deity and has no concern for anything but his own ambitions, and Pastor Burns’ support for him is an obviously opportunistic move by a man willing to sacrifice his principles for money. Williams is absolutely right to call him out on it. A bombing suspect over the explosion in Chelsea and the placing of several other improvised explosive devices throughout New Jersey is in custody.
