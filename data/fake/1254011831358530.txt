Comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis recently featured former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his improvisational comedy interview show, Between Two Ferns. Previously, he’s interviewed President Obama as well as other celebrities like Brad Pitt and Justin Beiber, but there’s one person he refuses to have on the show. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Galifianakis was asked if he would have Republican nominee Donald Trump on his show since his interview with Clinton was such a resounding success – and his answer is hilarious. “No. That doesn’t interest me. Doing it the other way doesn’t interest me. He’s the kind of guy who likes attention – bad attention or good attention. So you’re dealing with a psychosis there that’s a little weird. I wouldn’t have somebody on that’s so mentally challenged. I feel like I’d be taking advantage of him. And you can print that.”. Between Two Ferns is known for its exceptionally awkward dialogue and for the host’s fondness for asking uncomfortable questions (he once asked Pres. Obama “How does it feel to know you’re going to be the last black president?”). Part of the joke is both parties attempting to maintain their composure and not rising to the bait. Judging from the way that Donald Trump lashes out like a wounded animal at the slightest provocation and is utterly incapable of letting the pettiest slight go without a response, it’s safe to say that Galifinakis is right about how Trump would fare on his show. But it’s terrifying to think that a man who couldn’t handle being on a comedy interview show has a real shot at ascending to the presidency of the United States; he has shown time and time again that he is temperamentally unfit for the office.
