Donald Trump's campaign said Tuesday that his campaign has pulled in $18 million in online donations in the 24 hours after Monday night's debate with Hillary Clinton. “As a result of Donald Trump’s huge debate win last night, we had a massive fundraising day bringing in more than $18 million.” the Republican presidential nominee's campaign announced. The Trump campaign raised $70 million in the month of August. This figure trailed Clinton’s fundraising figures by $42 million. Trump's touting of fundraising marks a shift from Trump's primary strategy, where he touted himself as a candidate who, unlike his rivals, would not be beholden to donors. In the general election, however, Trump has shattered Republican records for fundraising from small donors.
